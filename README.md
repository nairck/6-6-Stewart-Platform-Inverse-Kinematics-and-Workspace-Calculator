# 6-6_Stewart_Platform_InverseKinematicsCalculator
An initial program prototype for the inverse kinematic solutions for any general 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform. 

This program was specifically designed for the alignment of an input focus for an optical bench pathfinder instrument.
In the zero-displacement configuration, 6 base and 6 platform X and Y coordinates can be input, with limits, and Z distances to each plane, 
the length of each prismatic joint is given, with relative distances from previous posture, and absolute distances from Z.D.C. to monitor joint limits.

The original code was from this paper:

and modified for our case.
